# Kurt's dotfiles

## Vim

The precious `.vimrc` is the most important dotfile I've got considering that it
holds my Vim configuration.

## Bash

Just a few tweaks to `.bash_profile`. The only essential piece in there is `.git-completion.sh` which comes from here: https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash.
